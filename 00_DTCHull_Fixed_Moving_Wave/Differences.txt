Modified:
0.orig/
    - omega                 (minor) added: hull {blended true;}
    - U                     (minor) added: atmosphere {tangentialVelocity $internalField;}
system/
    - controlDict           (major) modified: deltaT, endTime, writeControl, writeInterval; added: variable time step using Courant no.
    - fvSchemes             (minor) modified: ddtSchemes {default Euler;}, previously it was "localEuler"
    - fvSolution            (major) several modifications, see the files
    - snappyHexMeshDict     (minor) modified: featureAngle; added: "mergePatchFacesAngle", "layerTerminationAngle", "slipFeatureAngle"

Added:
constant/
    - dynamicMeshDict           :\ Rigid-body Motion Solver and, Mass, Inertia and Motion related properties
    - dynamicMeshDict.sixDoF    :/ https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/DynamicMeshDict (Is this used?)

DTCHull vs DTCHullWave(OpenFoam-dev)
Modified:
0.orig/
    - alpha.water           (minor) modified: inlet {type   waveAlpha;}, previously "fixedValue"
    - p_rgh                 (minor) modified: atmosphere {type prghEntrainmentPressure;}, previously "totalPressure"
    - U                     (minor) modified: inlet {type   waveVelocity}, outlet {UnMean   #neg $UxMean;}, UMean is replaced by UnMean and UxMean
                                    added: atmosphere {tangentialVelocity $internalField;}
system/
    - controlDict           (major) modified: deltaT, endTime, writeControl, writeInterval;
                                    added: variable time step using Courant no., post-processing function for saving free surface vtk file
    - blockMeshDict         (minor) modified: block is 6m shorter in front of the hull (16m to 10m), Mesh no. in x-dir: from 42 to 36
    - decomposeParDict      (minor) modified: decomposition method: from "hierarchical" to "scotch"
    - fvSchemes             (minor) modified: ddtSchemes {default Euler;}, previously it was "localEuler", also a couple of changes in "divSchemes"
    - fvSolution            (major) several modifications, see the files (more similar to DTCHullMoving)
    - snappyHexMeshDict     (minor) basically same as DTCHull, setting geometry STL file is a little different

Allrun                      (major) meshing is moved to "Allmesh", "setFields" is "replaced with "setWaves"

Added:
constant/
    - dynamicMeshDict           : same as DTCHullMoving (not .sixDoF one)
    - momentumTransport         : replaces the "turbulenceProperties" (same content)
    - phaseProperties           :\
    - physicalProperties.air    : \ replaces the "transportProperties" (separated into 3 files)
    - physicalProperties.water  :/  uses "viscoisityModel constant;" instead of "transportModel  Newtonian;"
    - waveProperties            : sets "Waterline height", "Stroke2 Wave properties", "U value"

system/
    - setWavesDict              : repalces the "setFieldsDict"
    - surfaceFeatureDict        : replaces the "surfaceFeatureExtractDict" (basically same)
    - topoSetDict               : repalces the six "topoSetDict.x" (combines them in single file, cellSet names are different)

Allmesh                         : reads topoSet properties from single "topoSetDict" file
