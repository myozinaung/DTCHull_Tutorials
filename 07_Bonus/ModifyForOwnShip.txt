### List of Things to Modify for Your Own Ship ###

#-------------- Mesh-generation related files --------------------#
# system/
#   - blockMeshDict                 : adjust the blocks and mesh size acrd. to your model/ship size, adjust the free surface location and mesh density
#   - refineMeshDict                (no changes)
#   - topoSetDict.1                  \
#   - topoSetDict.2                   \   adjust the number and size of refinement regions.
#   - topoSetDict.3                    \  At each refinement level, the new region should be completely within the previous region
#   - topoSetDict.4                    /  check the recommended relative size of final refinement mesh compared to ship geometry size
#   - topoSetDict.5                   /
#   - topoSetDict.6                  /
#   - surfaceFeatureExtractDict     : set the name of your STL file
#   - meshQualityDict               (no changes) unless you want otherwise
#   - snappyHexMMeshDict            : set the name of your STL and eMesh file
                                    : adjust Maximum cell numbers acrd. to how you set up in blockMesh and refineMesh steps
                                    : When you use higher mesh density and larger refinement regions, cell limits should be increased to keep the mesh quality
                                    : Adjust no. of boundry layers and their thickness (expansion ratio)
                                    : Tutorial case use Wall Functions for hull boundry, so the first cell center needs to be placed in the log-law region (30 < y+ < 200)

#   - DTC-scaled.stl.gz             : your STL file (no need if you automatically copy in command line)

#-------- Numerics, Initilization and Simulation Control ---------#
# system/
#   - controlDict                   : set forces and moment measuring point (CofR), not essential if you are only interested in Resistance forces
                                    : You may want adjust time and time step settings if your model size is drastically different from tutorial DTC model
                                    : You may want to use variable time step depending on Maximum Courant Number
                                    : You may add additional functions for post-processing
#   - fvSchemes                     (no changes) unless you want otherwise
#   - fvSolutions                   (no changes) unless you want otherwise (may increase "nNonOrthogonalCorrectors" if the mesh Non-orthogonal quality is not very good)
#   - setFieldsDict                 : adjust the water height
#   - decomposeDict                 : Set to your available CPU cores/threads, not reommended to decompose a small case to many CPU cores, it could take longer due to communication bottle neck.
