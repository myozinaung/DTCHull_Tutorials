Rename	Remove ".orig" from all file within "0" folder
Rename	"0" folder to "0.orig"
Replace	"cleanCase" with "cleanCase0" in "Allclean" (better to replace the whold "Allclean" file)
Add "restore0Dir"	in Allrun (just before setFields)

U				-->	#neg doesn't work (modfiy not to include that)
					outlet --> change "UnMean" to "Umean" 

Move "renumberMesh" from "Allmesh" to "Allrun"
	--> put it after "decomposePar"
	--> run in Parallel
	--> also remove "-noFileds" option


controlDict			-->	"rigidBodySate" function object doesn't work
					--> replace with "sixDoFRigidBodyState"
					--> replace "dynamicMeshDict" with "dynamicMeshDict.sixDoF" (switch file names)

surfaceFeatures		-->	surfaceFeatureExtract
surfaceFeaturesDict	-->	surfaceFeatureExtractDict (includedAngle 150 --> 155 for Bow Thruster)

blockMesh			-->	OK
blockMeshDict 		-->	change "convertToMeters" to "scale"

refineMesh			-->	OK
refineMeshDict		-->	OK
topoSet			-->	OK
topoSetDict			-->	OK

snappyHexMesh		-->	OK
snappyHexMesh		-->	OK
meshQualityDict		-->	OK

checkMesh			-->	OK

setFields			-->	OK
setFieldsDict		-->	OK

decomposePar		-->	OK (DON'T FORGET to decompose into HPC cores)

renumberMesh		-->	OK (this may need to run on HPC if local PC doesn't have enough cores)
--------- on HPC ---------------
interFoam			-->	OK

dynamicMeshDict		-->	OK
dynamicMeshDict.sixDoF	-->	OK

reconstructPar		-->	OK

postProcessing		--> 	forces --> file name and write format/column no. are different
					sixDoFRigidBodyState --> file name and write format/column no. are different
