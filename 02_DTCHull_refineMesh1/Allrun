## Block mesh generation with z-direction refinement
runApplication blockMesh # from tutorial 01

## Refinement in x and y-directions around the ship hull
runApplication -s "1" \
    topoSet -dict system/topoSetDict.1 # define the box region to refine 

runApplication -s "1" \
    refineMesh -dict system/refineMeshDict -overwrite # refine mesh on existing mesh (Overwrite the existing mesh files)
    # 1 cell becomes 4 cells in 2D view, 8 cells in 3D

# Create a ".foam" file for ParaView
touch a.foam # name is your choice
