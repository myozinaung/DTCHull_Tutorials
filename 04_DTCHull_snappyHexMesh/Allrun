## Block mesh generation with z-direction refinement
runApplication blockMesh 


## Refinement in x and y-directions around the ship hull
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 # do refinement 6 times, each time the refinement box region gets smaller, final 6th refinement is just around the hull geometry
do
    runApplication -s "$i" \
        topoSet -dict system/topoSetDict.${i} # define the box region to refine (see topoSetDict files)

    runApplication -s "$i" \
        refineMesh -dict system/refineMeshDict -overwrite # refine mesh on existing mesh (Overwrite the existing mesh files)
        # 1 cell in box region becomes 4 cells in 2D view, 8 cells in 3D after each refinement
done
# mesh size after final refinement is about 1.4 million, this will get less after trimming the hull geometry using "snappyHexMesh" (next tutorial)


## Cut out the hull geometry from refined block mesh
# First, copy the hull surface .stl file to "constant/triSurface" folder
mkdir -p constant/triSurface # create "triSurface" folder in "constant" directory

# copy DTC hull surface from resources folder to "triSurface" folder
cp -f \
    "$FOAM_TUTORIALS"/resources/geometry/DTC-scaled.stl.gz \
    constant/triSurface/
# the hull surface STL file must be completely watertight manifold (include deck and transom, no free edges, no holes), 
# Blender 3D-Print tool can be used to check and repair some manifold problems

# Extract Edge Mesh (.eMesh) for feature edge refinement (refine any cell intersected by the edges to a specified level)
runApplication surfaceFeatureExtract
# if your file name is different, don't forget to change the file names in "surfaceFeatureExtractDict"
# check the generated files in the "extendedFeatureEdgeMesh", .eMesh file is generated in "triSurface" folder

runApplication snappyHexMesh -overwrite # see snappyHexMeshDict for its steps and more information
# snappyHexMesh uses "STL surface mesh" and "eMesh edge mesh" files
# if your file names are different, don't forget to change the file names in "snappyHexMeshDict" (2 places, STL and eMesh)
# Need to add write-related settings in "controlDict"
# the files in "constant/polyMesh" folder are updated

runApplication checkMesh # (see "log.checkMesh" file)
# Meshing finished, Yayyyy....

# Create a ".foam" file for ParaView
touch a.foam # name is your choice
