## Block mesh generation with z-direction refinement
runApplication blockMesh 

## Refinement in x and y-directions around the ship hull
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 # do refinement 6 times, each time the refinement box region gets smaller, final 6th refinement is just around the hull geometry
do
    runApplication -s "$i" \
        topoSet -dict system/topoSetDict.${i} # define the box region to refine (see topoSetDict files)

    runApplication -s "$i" \
        refineMesh -dict system/refineMeshDict -overwrite # refine mesh on existing mesh (Overwrite the existing mesh files)
        # 1 cell in box region becomes 4 cells  after each refinement
done
# mesh size after final refinement is about 1.4 million, this will get less after trimming the hull geometry using "snappyHexMesh" (next tutorial)

# Create a ".foam" file for ParaView
touch a.foam # name is your choice
